    Otolith is an application for positioning dots on photos of calcified fish parts,
    such as scales, otoliths, fin rays, etc.
    <br>
    Each reader positions the points that correspond, for him, to a growth indicator (annual ring, for example).
    Once all the readings have been taken, it is possible to display all the readings taken on a species, 
    then create a 'consensus reading'.
